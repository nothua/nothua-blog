","content":"<p>I've been working on this little Electron app that lets me manage blog posts. With a little twist of syncing up with GitHub, so every post I create, update, or delete is safely stored as a JSON file in my <a href=\"https://github.com/nothua/nothua-blog/tree/main\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">repo</a>. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Blogging Made Easy</strong>: Whether I'm creating up a new post or making changes to an old one, it’s a lot simple. Having the blogs in GitHub repo, there's version control too and easy access.  </p><p><strong>No Server Costs</strong>: You don’t have to worry about server hosting or deploying a backend. Everything's handled by GitHub and the app, so it’s totally free to run. </p><p><strong>No Need for Jekyll or Other Frameworks</strong>: If you're looking for something dynamic to host blogs without using things like Jekyll and all then this solution works best</p><p><br></p><p>This setup makes everything so much easier for me since I'm hosting my site on Render. It’s practically just a static site, with the only dynamic part being the fetching of the <code>blogs.json</code> file in my repository root. just a clean and simple way to manage content.</p><p><br></p><p>Can also be noted that you can use GitHub Pages with this which would all come down to practically all GitHub and no cost for a site that adds dynamic content. </p>","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothua/nothua-blog/main/images/start-your-blog-with-just-a-static-site-and-github.png","date":"25-8-2024"}
